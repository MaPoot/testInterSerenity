Feature: Cleaning session API - Negative Scenarios

  Scenario Outline: For invalid instructions the API should give a 400 response
    Given A room of dimension
      | x | y |
      | 1 | 1 |
    And Set the initial position of the Hover to
      | x | y |
      | 0 | 0 |
    And Set the dirt patches
      | x | y |
      | 0 | 0 |
    And I set the instructions "<Instructions>"
    When Send a POST request to "/cleaning-sessions"
    Then Validate the response code is 400
    Examples:
      | Instructions |
      | AAAAAA       |
      | NNEEAAWW     |
      | 11111111     |

      | EEAAWW       |

  Scenario: WHen initial position is out of range the API should give 400 response

      | x  | y  |
      | -1 | -1 |
    And Set the dirt patches
      | x | y |
      | 1 | 0 |
      | 2 | 2 |
      | 2 | 3 |

  Scenario: When we send more than two dimensional room API should return an error code
    Given A room of dimension
      | x | y | z |

      | 1 | 2 |
    And Set the dirt patches
      | x | y |
      | 1 | 0 |
      | 2 | 2 |
      | 2 | 3 |
    And I set the instructions "NNESEESWNWW"
